Flutter Mobile Application Project by Eraasoft Interns
Welcome to our Flutter mobile application project developed during our internship at Eraasoft! This project is aimed at making doctor reservations easy and efficient. Users can seamlessly reserve appointments with doctors, whether they're looking for a specialist or a general practitioner. With advanced search and filter features, finding the perfect healthcare provider is a breeze.

Key Features
Doctor Reservations: Users can easily reserve appointments with doctors of their choice.

Advanced Search and Filters: Our app provides advanced search and filter options to help users find the right healthcare provider with precision.

Appointment Management: The app automatically removes missed appointments from the list, ensuring users stay organized and never miss an appointment.

Technologies Used
MVVM Architecture: Our project follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern to ensure clean and organized code.

Cubit for State Management: We utilize Cubit for state management in our Flutter application, simplifying complex UI interactions and data flow.

API Integration with Dio: Our app seamlessly integrates with Duo using GET and POST requests to fetch and send data.
